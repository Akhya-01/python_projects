TeleChurn: Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

Project Description:
Overview:
TeleChurn is a Python-based data analysis and machine learning project designed to analyze telecom customer data, with a specific focus on predicting customer churn. The project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and churn prediction using machine learning models like Logistic Regression.

The program simulates a telecom customer base, generates synthetic data, and provides insights into customer behavior. It predicts the likelihood of churn based on key features such as service type, usage minutes, data usage, monthly bill, and demographics.

Objectives:
Customer Churn Analysis:
Investigate customer churn patterns and identify which features are most correlated with churn (e.g., service type, usage, age).

Churn Prediction Model:
Build a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or stay based on historical data.

Customer Segmentation:
Segment customers into groups based on usage patterns (e.g., call minutes, data usage) using K-means clustering, allowing for more targeted retention strategies.

Visualization & Insights:
Visualize key metrics such as churn rate, average usage by service type, and customer demographics to generate actionable business insights for telecom companies.

Key Features:
Data Generation & Preprocessing:

Generate synthetic telecom data including customer demographics, service type, usage patterns, and churn status.

Clean and preprocess data by encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the churn distribution, usage by service type, and correlation between features.

Explore relationships between key features like age, monthly bill, and churn rate.

Churn Prediction:

Use Logistic Regression to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, achieving high prediction accuracy.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Customer Segmentation:

Apply K-means clustering to group customers based on usage behavior, identifying potential market segments for personalized retention strategies.

Business Insights & Recommendations:

Analyze and summarize customer behavior to help telecom companies optimize customer retention efforts.

Generate reports with actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn.
